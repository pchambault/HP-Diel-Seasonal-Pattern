Harbour porpoises synchronize their diving behaviour with the polar night

In the nightscape of the winter Arctic: polar night drives the diving behaviour of harbour porpoises

How daylength shapes the diving behaviour of harbour porpoises in the dark Arctic winter

Why harbour porpoises search for deep and dark waters in the winter Arctic?

Extreme deep dives in a small cetacean are shaped by the boreal nightscape in winter

The polar night shapes the deep diving behaviour of small cetacean, the harbour porpoise

Searching for darkness: how small cetaceans synchronize their dive depth with the Arctic nightscape in winter

Diving into the darkness of the polar night: how harbour porpoises synchronize their dive depth with daylength
